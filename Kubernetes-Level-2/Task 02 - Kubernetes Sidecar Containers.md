# Task 02: Kubernetes Sidecar Containers

## Question

We have a web server container running the nginx image. The access and error logs generated by the web server are not critical enough to be placed on a persistent volume. However, Nautilus developers need access to the last 24 hours of logs so that they can trace issues and bugs. Therefore, we need to ship the access and error logs for the web server to a log-aggregation service. Following the separation of concerns principle, we implement the Sidecar pattern by deploying a second container that ships the error and access logs from nginx. Nginx does one thing, and it does it wellâ€”serving web pages. The second container also specializes in its taskâ€”shipping logs. Since containers are running on the same Pod, we can use a shared emptyDir volume to read and write logs.

**Task:**

1. Create a pod named `webserver`.

2. Create an `emptyDir` volume `shared-logs`.

3. Create two containers from `nginx` and `ubuntu` images with `latest` tag only and remember to mention tag i.e `nginx:latest`, nginx container name should be `nginx-container` and ubuntu container name should be `sidecar-container` on webserver pod.

4. Add command on sidecar-container `"sh","-c","while true; do cat /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/error.log; sleep 30; done"`

5. Mount the volume `shared-logs` on both containers at location `/var/log/nginx`, all containers should be up and running.

`Note:` The `kubectl` utility on `jump_host` is set up to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.

## âœ… YAML Solution

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: webserver
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: shared-logs
    emptyDir: {}
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
    image: nginx:latest
    volumeMounts:
    - name: shared-logs
      mountPath: /var/log/nginx
  - name: sidecar-container
    image: ubuntu:latest
    command: ["sh", "-c", "while true; do cat /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/error.log; sleep 30; done"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: shared-logs
      mountPath: /var/log/nginx
```

## âš¡ Explanation

1. **Pod name** â†’ `webserver`

2. **Volume** â†’ `emptyDir` named `shared-logs`.

  - This creates temporary storage shared between containers (lives as long as the pod lives).

3. **Containers**:

  - `nginx-container` runs `nginx:latest`, writes logs to `/var/log/nginx`.
  - `sidecar-container` runs `ubuntu:latest`, tails logs every 30s using the given command.

4. **Volume mount** â†’ Both containers mount the `shared-logs` volume at `/var/log/nginx`.

ðŸ‘‰ To apply it, save the manifest as webserver.yaml and run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f webserver.yaml
```

Check pod status:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

See logs from the sidecar container:

```bash
kubectl logs -f webserver -c sidecar-container
```
